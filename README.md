APereiras's Etch-a-Sketch: a Javascript project for The Odin Project's Foundations Course!

The program creates a custom grid with user-defined box sizes. It paints a random color in each box the mouse hovers.

This project gave me a much clearer understanding of the fundamental DOM manipulation tools at my disposal (creating and editing elements, changing attributes, using event listeners, etc.).

While working on this project, the biggest challenge was definately figuring out how to make the cursor darken each box's color independently on subsequent hovers, all while not interfering with other color values or resetting after the event ended. Trying to solve this problem, I started to realize that attributes from a single element can be used as variables, and had a small glimpse into the endless possible applications of this feature.
